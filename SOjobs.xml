We democratize the right to succeed by giving families living in poverty access to the high-quality education that will allow their children to live a very different life. We leverage experts, data, and technology in order to standardize and scale every aspect of quality education delivery, from how and where academies are built to how teachers are selected and trained, and how lessons are delivered and monitored for improvement. We are vertically-integrated, tech-enabled, and on our way to profitability. Bridge expects to continue its rapid expansion in Africa and India in the coming years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bridge Offer&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roughly 2.7 billion people live on less than $2/day. In their communities, there is a huge gap between the education offered and the needs of the population. Too often the schools available to them fail to deliver for these families. The quality offered results in the average pupil from our communities in East Africa failing to reach proficiency in primary school and on average fail the primary exit exams that are critical to their development. Teachers are unresponsive and occasionally abusive, and fees are often unaffordable. Even government schools can cost families a significant amount of money after all the additional fees are added up. With 47% of classroom teaching time lost due to teacher absenteeism or neglect, 55% of families in our communities end up choosing private schools instead, but then fear for the stability and sustainability of their choice as many schools close after only a few years of service. Both the government schools and the private schools tend to lack well-conceived scope and sequences, instructional materials, student achievement data, and the capacity to react to that data. Families are actively searching for a better academic alternative. Enter Bridge International Academies. As of September 2016, Bridge operates more than 500 academies worldwide, serving roughly 100,000 pupils in Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, India, and Liberia. Bridge utilises a scripted-learning education methodology coupled with 'big data' (all teachers have tablets for instruction, assessment, and data-gathering) that allows us to make curriculum a little better every day. With plans to enrol ten million students ten years from now, Bridge International Academies offers a tremendous opportunity to grow with one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most exciting, ambitious, and socially conscious companies, with leadership roles available across a number of competencies and geographies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech at Bridge&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Technology plays a critical role at Bridge in enabling us to provide education at massive scale and low cost &amp;ndash; it's one of the key elements that gives us the ability to deliver what no one else can. Tech spans Director of Business Intelligence several key functions, from the hardware and software that our academies use to run all aspects of teaching and management, including mobile payments, to the systems that enable our country headquarters to manage massive local operations, to the data backbone that informs all of our strategic and tactical decision making. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of custom software development and a lot of back office systems. We've got a ridiculously ambitious mission at Bridge, and it's a place where passionate technologists have a chance to directly change the world. No kidding. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tech at Bridge is a highly complex, vertically-integrated affair, with systems supporting an ever expanding range of functions and countries, and crossing between software development, IT operations, academy operations, and logistics/supply chain. At the same time, our teams run lean and things change fast &amp;ndash; governments make policy decisions that affect us, launching new countries is a frenetic affair, and we still need to evolve our core technology offering. Bridge has been data driven from its inception, using a build-measure-learn approach to all aspects of service delivery. As a scale model business, we have an unprecedented opportunity to bring statistical power to all aspects of our operation, from the academics team using randomised controlled trials to validate the best teaching mechanisms to the customer experience team understanding what is most important to our families to operational teams striving to improve our service delivery efficiency. However, we have reached an inflection point where we need to take our data game to the next level. Instead of just providing data to our various departments, we need to start bringing to bear more sophisticated techniques to unlock the potential of our significant data sets. While we collect tens of thousands of data points every term from each of our academies &amp;ndash; from the time spent on each page of a lesson to the billing and payment history of every pupil &amp;ndash; we are yet to fully realise the potential energy of these data sets. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for a Director of Business Intelligence, who will report directly to the CTO and who can take this organisational passion for data and translate it into ever more actionable insights for our internal departments, as well as developing develop data insights that will support additional revenue streams and frame Bridge as the premier learning management platform, extending even beyond the academies that we operate. This role is about really nerding out about data; but also translating that passion into tools that will improve all aspects of our service delivery. It will involve collaborating with experts and data scientists/analysts in other departments to deliver meaningful insights, while also pushing and supporting them with techniques that they could not yet begin to imagine. From adaptive curriculum to fraud detection to predictive analytics, the possibilities are endless. The Director of Business Intelligence will oversee a team that includes data warehousing, ETL, and ad hoc analysis, while also working with software development and UX experts to devise and deliver business intelligence products, such as data dashboards&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Will Do&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define, architect and build complex large scale real-time data processing platforms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oversee the design, delivery, and governance of the core data warehouse. &amp;nbsp;Design and deliver data products (esp. dashboards) to support core Bridge functions, with delivery support from software teams for implementation. Collaborate with data analysts and scientists in other departments to gather requirements and deliver insights. Director of Business Intelligence&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with global and country executive leadership to define and present key business insights, from finance to operations to academies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leverage advanced techniques, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, to drive insights on topics like fraud detection, marketing (pupil attraction/retention), and adaptive curriculum &amp;ndash; to name a few.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Should Have&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bachelor's degree in related field with superior academic performance. Experience with visualisation tools such as Tableau, Pentaho, or (especially) PowerBI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of programming languages like R or Python. Additional languages a plus: C#, F#, Java, JavaScript and frameworks (esp. D3.js)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with a variety of databases: MS-SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, S3, Memcached, Elasticsearch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of data science tools, such as iPython, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas, Word2vec, Matlab, Octave, R, Rapidminer, Bigml, Cytoscape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with tools and frameworks such as Kafka, Spark, Hadoop, AirBrake, Nagios, Storm, Cascading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with analytic tools such as Analytics Google Analytics, Graphite, Kissmetrics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A belief in treating BI as a first-class software citizen &amp;ndash; source control (git), testing (e.g. Cucumber), controlled deployments, and Agile development. Comfort working in a company that acts and feels a lot like a startup (dynamic, unstructured, and frequently changing), but at the same time has global reach and ambitious international expansion plans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent verbal and written communications and interpersonal skills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Passion for Bridge's vision of democratising the right for all children to succeed. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re also&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A detailed doer &amp;ndash; You have a track record of getting things done. You&amp;rsquo;re organized and responsive. You take ownership of every idea you touch and execute it to a fine level of detail, setting targets, engaging others, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. You can multi-task dozens of such projects at once and never lose sight of the details. Likely, you have some experience in a start-up or other rapid-growth company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A networking mastermind &amp;ndash; You excel at meeting new people and turning them into advocates. You communicate in a clear, conscientious, and effective way in both written and oral speech. You can influence strangers in the course of a single conversation. Allies and colleagues will go to bat for your ideas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A creative problem-solver &amp;ndash; Growing any business from scratch comes with massive and constant challenges. On top of that, Bridge works in volatile, low-resource communities and runs on fees averaging just $6 a month per pupil. You need to be flexible and ready to get everything done effectively, quickly, and affordably with the materials at hand. Every dollar you spend is a dollar our customers, who live on less than $2 a day, will have to pay for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A customer advocate &amp;ndash; Our customers &amp;ndash; these families living on less than $2 a day per person &amp;ndash; never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent&amp;rsquo;s hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their customer benefit, experience, and value.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A life-long learner &amp;ndash; You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you&amp;rsquo;ve missed things or failed today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2016 11:16:01 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-11-15T11:16:01Z</a10:updated><location xmlns="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/">London, UK</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/128937/scala-engineer-depop</guid><link>http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/128937/scala-engineer-depop</link><a10:author><a10:name>Depop</a10:name></a10:author><category>scala</category><category>rabbitmq</category><category>cassandra</category><title>Scala Engineer at Depop (London, UK)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;We're looking for someone to be part of the team building the backbone of our app. Depop is a fantastic place for engineers who love to solve interesting problems that come with the high growth we've continually seen.

Working on the next generation Mali&amp;trade; mobile GPUs and the latest yet-to-be-published Android versions, you will help shape the technologies that the mobile market will see in years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Job Description&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will be joining a multinational and dynamic Agile software development team located in Cambridge (UK). The team is responsible for the Compute Runtime component of the driver implementing the OpenCL and RenderScript APIs. OpenCL allows massively parallel execution of general purpose (C-like) code on the Mali GPUs, often known as GPGPU (General Purpose computing on the GPU).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GPGPU team&amp;rsquo;s challenge is to provide robust and performant functionality in a highly constrained environment.&amp;nbsp;Compute Runtime is a complex, power-efficient and performance-critical component of the Mali GPU driver stack. Embedded GPGPU use cases include image processing, computer vision, video and virtual reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The Compute Runtime component works in close conjunction with the LLVM-based runtime compiler (developed by a separate team in the same building) and must efficiently interoperate with other parts of the driver stack. You will need embedded software development and optimization skills, but previous experience of GPGPU is not essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This role represents a senior engineering position within the GPGPU team, and as such involves not just engineering, but the ability to guide and inspire other more junior engineers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; Join us to help us make GPGPU and Mali a success in other peoples&amp;rsquo; hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role involves cooperating with fellow ARM GPU driver stack developers across three continents, with a primary focus on the Compute Runtime component. We have a roadmap of features to be implemented, and at the same time need to continuously improve the driver&amp;rsquo;s performance, and ensure that existing customers continue to receive a robust and performant product.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Day to day:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The role will involve the design and implementation of new features and tests, as well as the benchmarking, maintenance and optimisation of existing areas of the driver. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Your day to day role will involve the design and implementation of new features and tests, as well as the benchmarking, maintenance and optimisation of existing areas of the driver.&amp;nbsp;As a senior member of the team you will be expected to guide and mentor more junior members of the team, as well as take a leading role in designs and discussions. We value proactivity and enthusiasm, and look to our senior engineers to encourage and lead others, as well as to be the source of new ideas and initiatives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will work in a Linux environment, coding and debugging for ARM-based targets including models, FPGAs and silicon from our partner companies (thereby covering past, present and future generations of our designs). As a member of an Agile team you will have the chance to try your hand at all aspects of our work. Engineers grow their expertise through this work, through on and off the job training, and through peer code reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the great things about working at ARM is that if you have a question about another component, you can usually speak directly to the designer, whether it&amp;rsquo;s other software, hardware or tooling. Over the years engineers develop into specialised experts, generalists, or transition to other disciplines such as project and product management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Media Processing Group:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Media Processing Group produces multimedia hardware and software products for mobile and embedded devices.

You&amp;rsquo;ve built backends in one or more mainstream frameworks using Java, .NET, nodejs, etc. You think in REST and always notice when your CSS is off by a pixel. Modeling the databases and building the engines behind UIs gets your gears turning just as much as animating a button. You know the difference between call() and apply(), but you also know it usually doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. Apps that react as fast as you can click have you opening up the source code. Working with more junior developers gets you excited for the coaching opportunities, and more senior developers for the learning. Groking the business requirements is second-nature. You own what you wrote and jump in to help your team support the product when there&amp;rsquo;s a fire, and when the smoke clears you&amp;rsquo;re one of the first to say &amp;ldquo;ok, how can we make sure that doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen again?&amp;rdquo;. You&amp;rsquo;re passionate and opinionated about great user experience; and most importantly, you love building real, working apps that surprise and delight your customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT YOU&amp;rsquo;D BE DOING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under general supervision of the Engineering Manager, the Promotions B2B Engineer is a full-stack engineer with a bent for hard front-end problems, performing assignments in one or more of the following areas: providing technical guidance and direction to other staff members; participating in project planning and requirements definition; system/application design, system/application development, unit testing, support during QA and User Acceptance Testing, implementation and integration; customer support for and technical expertise in end-user decision support software tools and end-user computing technology; conducting all activities in accordance with standards and procedures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;MAJOR JOB RESPONSIBILITIES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Design, develop, test, deploy, and support new software solutions and changes to existing software solutions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Troubleshoot technical issues in a variety of application environments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mentor team members and provide thoughtful discussion on tactics and strategies as they are selected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Translate business requirements and product specifications into components of complex, loosely-coupled, distributed systems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maintain a focus on rapid delivery of new features to market while maintaining stability and uptime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maintain familiarity with the evolving trends in software development&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Oct 2016 18:45:46 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-10-28T18:45:46Z</a10:updated></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/128275/php-developer-croud</guid><link>http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/128275/php-developer-croud</link><a10:author><a10:name>Croud</a10:name></a10:author><category>php</category><category>html5</category><category>css3</category><category>javascript</category><category>jquery</category><title>PHP Developer at Croud (Shrewsbury, UK)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OVERALL PURPOSE OF THE ROLE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enthusiastic PHP developer required for a fast growing and technically driven digital marketing agency.

We recognise that this is a really big responsibility and we are proud and excited to be able to make such a big impact on people's daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We love our devs! They are an awesome bunch that feel the same way about our product as we do, so we try our best to give them all the support and tools they need to deliver this world changing product. We don't like getting in the way, so in general we try to enable others to do things themselves, by automating as much as possible and giving them the buttons to push. This isn't easy because the environment needs to be PCI compliant, but we see that as a cool challenge, and so far we are doing great!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also love AWS. AWS services like EC2 and RDS allow us to do so much with so little, so we use it as much as possible and try avoid deploying anything to our in-house VMware cluster. We also like Docker - we don't love it yet, but who knows :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a lot of fun in Ops, mostly laughing at with each other about stupid things, but when the business needs us, we are there for them. We believe that it is our personal responsibility to ensure that our commuter friends in Boston or Athens or New York are able to ride the train/bus with our app, so we do everything that it takes to ensure that happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The person we are looking for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will have some years of commercial experience in computing, either in ops or in development. You will be using Linux as your server OS of choice, but to be fair you&amp;rsquo;ll use whatever works. You can code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are currently in ops, from day one you have scripted your admin tasks, so you are comfortable talking about your code with a developer. You probably started out on bash, but nowadays you use something more powerful like Python or Ruby because bash just doesn&amp;rsquo;t cut it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are aware of the power of AWS and newer things like containerisation - either from your own commercial experience or because you play with them at home when you get bored. You don't rack servers, but you&amp;rsquo;ll help the Service Desk guy carry those boxes because he&amp;rsquo;s an awesome guy and, well, why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are currently a developer, infrastructure excites you and DevOps seems like an interesting new playground. You enjoy learning different programming languages and are not afraid of trying something new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although you enjoy working by yourself (normally at home, just getting things done) you are happier when working with your teammates, solving complex business-critical problems. Your teammates often become your friends, because they have similar interests to you, and you respect their contribution to the group. You get excited when someone can teach you something new. You get excited when someone near you succeeds, especially if you had a little something to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;Linux&lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp;Amazon EC2, RDS, ELB, Autoscaling, CloudFormation&lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp;Puppet, Artifactory&lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp;Jenkins, Bamboo&lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp;Git&lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp;MySQL&lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp;Logentries</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Oct 2016 12:32:50 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-10-28T12:32:50Z</a10:updated><location xmlns="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/">London, UK</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/127905/graduate-junior-java-developer-efinancialcareers</guid><link>http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/127905/graduate-junior-java-developer-efinancialcareers</link><a10:author><a10:name>eFinancialCareers</a10:name></a10:author><category>java</category><category>java-ee</category><category>spring</category><category>tdd</category><title>Graduate/Junior Java Developer at eFinancialCareers (London, UK)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are looking to hire a Graduate/Junior Java/J2EE Developer.

LifeWorks&amp;rsquo; mobile employee engagement and wellness platform puts the employee at the heart of its business. Having recently signed a joint venture with Ceridian the company is going from strength to strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At LifeWorks, Front-End is not an afterthought. We believe that only simple and elegant JavaScript code makes delightful user experiences. React has been a game changer for us. We dropped it in the code base on year ago, and the benefits are substantial: easier to learn, easier to write, easier to maintain and easier to debug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re not just using React but some bits of the so-called ecosystem: Webpack, Immutable, inline styles. What&amp;rsquo;s not to like?! In case you&amp;rsquo;re wondering, yes we&amp;rsquo;re using es6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;No lies here, we still have some Angular bits but that makes an exciting challenge to find ways to get rid of it. We favor quality over quantity. That&amp;rsquo;s why we take time to review every piece of code that gets merged. And we also have the mandatory eslint. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we don&amp;rsquo;t move fast. We&amp;rsquo;ve switched to the GitHub flow (eg one git branch to rule them all) so that we can deploy to production every day!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of our team members have side projects. That&amp;rsquo;s one of our ways to drive innovation, by bringing ideas tested elsewhere. We&amp;rsquo;ve got a &amp;ldquo;Monthly Inspirational Front Do&amp;rdquo; which is the opportunity for one of us to shine :) We&amp;rsquo;re going to meetups (React, FP, etc.) and we also love fancy pubs and bars (or our very own Battersea-rooftop when it gets sunny!) We are Front-End Engineers with some full-stack experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2016 15:46:14 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-10-26T15:46:14Z</a10:updated><location xmlns="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/">London, UK</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/127739/backend-developer-lifeworks</guid><link>http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/127739/backend-developer-lifeworks</link><a10:author><a10:name>LifeWorks</a10:name></a10:author><category>php-5.4</category><category>zend-framework2</category><category>symfony2</category><category>laravel-4</category><category>silex</category><title>Backend Developer at LifeWorks (London, UK)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Join our highly motivated and talented team to work on the next phase of our responsive, "mobile first" web application offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will be involved in key platform decisions and work with technologies like Zend Framework 2, Silex, Slim, Symfony 2.5, MongoDB and more.

The application stack is built in Ruby, using Rails, and Javascript of course.

We encourage all development to be test-driven, and have regular code reviews and use automated code quality metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re big fans of automation, so any experience of that sort of automated software or infrastructure deployment would be of use.

The positions that flow through this infrastructure range from Exotic Equity derivatives to vanilla Equity options, Equity Swaps and plain stocks, covering roughly a million positions globally.

On top of that, Bridge works in volatile, low-resource communities and runs on fees averaging just $6 a month per pupil. You need to be flexible and ready to get everything done effectively, quickly, and affordably with the materials at hand.

You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent&amp;rsquo;s hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their customer benefit, experience, and value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A life-long learner &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others.

You&amp;rsquo;ll be joining an enthusiastic team who enjoy what they do. Things like Pair Programming, TDD/BDD, Refactoring, and Continuous Delivery are deeply embedded and we&amp;rsquo;re constantly striving to improve the way we work. We know &lt;a href="http://anarchycreek.com/2009/05/26/how-tdd-and-pairing-increase-production/" rel="nofollow"&gt;typing is not the bottleneck&lt;/a&gt;, so there are plenty of other things going on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can take part in regular weekly sessions sharing ideas, doing Katas/Dojos and discussing practices and technologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will get up to two days &amp;ldquo;innovation time&amp;rdquo; a month to investigate new technologies or product ideas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can attend conferences and community events, both as a participant or contributors - we&amp;rsquo;ve presented/ran sessions at XP2016, &lt;a href="http://qconlondon.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;QCon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.spaconference.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;SPA&lt;/a&gt;, Strata + Hadoop World, &lt;a href="http://agilecambridge.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Agile Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, Agile Manchester, &lt;a href="http://paris.apidays.io/2013/" rel="nofollow"&gt;APIdays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://paris.apidays.io/2013/" rel="nofollow"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.7digital.com/dev/2009/12/14/an-experience-report-about-our-experience-report/" rel="nofollow"&gt;XPDay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://agileonthebeach.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Agile on the Beach&lt;/a&gt; and many others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can help us host our own popular community event &amp;ndash; &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/devs-in-the-ditch" rel="nofollow"&gt;Devs in the &amp;lsquo;ditch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;We hold frequent retrospectives (as teams and the department) on how we can improve the way we work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we&amp;rsquo;re not perfect and not afraid to say so. We recognise we have many problems which need solving and a long way to go on our journey of continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You care about software; you have a passion for what you do which you can clearly convey by your actions rather than just waffly personal statements on your CV. For you it&amp;rsquo;s more than a job. You like to pick the right tool for the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You believe software development involves a lot more than just writing code. You see it as your remit to really understand our domain so we can all deliver as much value to the business as possible. When you do write code you believe it has to be done really well. To you, quality (both internal and external) really matters. These are things we really care about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experience otherwise is relative &amp;ndash; 2 years working in an agile/XP manner is worth much more to us than 5 in a traditional environment. If you&amp;rsquo;ve not got working experience with things like TDD and refactoring (maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to but your current job doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow for it) show us you&amp;rsquo;re at least familiar with the concepts and that you really want to work in this kind of environment and you&amp;rsquo;re still in with a good chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology you'll get to use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our production systems use C#, Node.js, Python, Java and we're investigating and running many other technologies and languages. We use a mixture of AWS and Google Cloud Platform, based around a distributed data architecture with Apache Kafka at the heart. We&amp;rsquo;d be interested in you if you&amp;rsquo;re from any background as long as you have a keen understanding of good programming practices. We have a strong devops culture and like to use services that help us create great products; from CDNs to monitoring to anomaly detection. We&amp;rsquo;d expect you to be proficient in more than one technology stack. Here&amp;rsquo;s a sample list of technologies we currently use:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;C#, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, Ruby&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;REST, Queues, Relational Databases, Document Databases, Infrastructure as code&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examples include: Postgres, SQL Server, Solr/Lucene/Elasticsearch, Redis, RabbitMQ and Varnish, Kafka, Spark, Nginx&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;We practice continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous improvement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re also very keen on open source. We contribute to some of the technologies listed above as well as maintaining our own forks (+ publishing other things we&amp;rsquo;d like to share) on &lt;a href="https://github.com/7digital" rel="nofollow"&gt;our GitHub account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/7digital" rel="nofollow"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2016 14:07:31 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-11-11T14:07:31Z</a10:updated><location xmlns="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/">London, UK</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/124517/senior-software-developer-simul8-corporation</guid><link>http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/124517/senior-software-developer-simul8-corporation</link><a10:author><a10:name>SIMUL8 Corporation</a10:name></a10:author><category>c#</category><category>asp.net-mvc</category><category>database</category><category>web</category><category>cloud</category><title>Senior Software Developer at SIMUL8 Corporation (Glasgow, UK)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be part of our team you must be:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passionate about technology&lt;/strong&gt;.

This stereotype refers to obstacles and separation between QA and Developers. The end result is tension within the team, owing to many issues such as a breakdown of communication.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here at Masabi we disagree with this stereotype. Our QA&amp;rsquo;s are an integral part of our teams, working alongside our product managers and developers to assure quality and completeness. QA is the heart and soul of ensuring that the capabilities which we are providing to our customers are as seamless and bug free as possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will you be doing as our Quality Analyst?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a QA at Masabi, you will be the key component of ensuring that the quality of our products is the responsibility of the team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will have the opportunity to work across a variety of applications and services including mobile apps, back office apps, APIs, databases, and even embedded software running the hardware readers that we fit to buses or station gates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;We follow agile principles, which means we regularly ship updates to our customers for pre checks and production. You will therefore be responsible for feature and regression testing these updates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Dev and QA teams are given the power to deploy to our pre-production customer environment, which is the way it should be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Devops is also something which we think is wonderful, however; we do not forget about QA in this. As a QA you will have valuable input into how we can improve our products and environment config.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will also have access to the chance to play with environment config in your very own test environment, to ensure that we find and squash as many of those bugs as we can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our test coverage consists of manual and automated testing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some tools we use:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Testrail&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Selenium&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Appium&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protractor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Puppet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bamboo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;MySQL Workbench.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Charles Proxy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;HockeyApp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Postman&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2016 16:08:49 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-11-05T16:08:49Z</a10:updated><location xmlns="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/">London, UK</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/126181/lead-full-stack-developer-wanted-to-build-and-social-circle</guid><link>http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/126181/lead-full-stack-developer-wanted-to-build-and-social-circle</link><a10:author><a10:name>Social Circle</a10:name></a10:author><category>php</category><category>angularjs</category><category>amazon-web-services</category><category>mysql</category><category>zend-framework</category><title>Lead Full Stack Developer wanted to build and head up new team at Social Circle (London, UK)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Social Circle keeps getting bigger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A short while ago we saw the need for a platform that tracks, trends, evaluates and reports on social influencers around the globe, so we built one.

You&amp;rsquo;ll be developing and maintaining the database environments and ensuring optimal security and auditing of all database environments. You&amp;rsquo;ll be installing, configuring and backing up all databases and ensuring patches are applied as and when required. There will be databases that require performance tuning and you&amp;rsquo;ll be an escalation point for incidents and problems relating to the databases, including out-of-hours on-call cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will also be managing and planning capacity requirements of the databases and it will be your responsibility to create and maintain documentation for all database systems and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tribe are a curious lot and they are always on the lookout for new technologies and open to suggestions for continuous improvements to the environment. As you can see, determination and curiosity are two company values that run deep throughout the tribe and they are looking for a likeminded individual to join them. The tribe uses an Agile and Kanban approach to assist with the delivery of any projects and work so you&amp;rsquo;ll feel comfortable with this way of working. DevOps is very much the mind-set when working with a variety of different people and teams around the business.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2016 20:25:12 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-11-10T20:25:12Z</a10:updated><location xmlns="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/">Manchester, UK</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/129004/development-team-lead-infrastructure-envato</guid><link>http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/129004/development-team-lead-infrastructure-envato</link><a10:author><a10:name>Envato</a10:name></a10:author><category>amazon-web-services</category><category>ruby-on-rails</category><category>infrastructure</category><category>web-applications</category><category>ddos</category><title>Development Team Lead (infrastructure architecture, large scale web apps) at Envato (Melbourne, Australia)</title><description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership opportunity in Envato Engineering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create &amp;amp; drive the Technical Vision for the Platform Infrastructure team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Named &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://inside.envato.com/envato-coolest-company-for-women/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Australia's Coolest Company for Women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &amp;amp; one of the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://press.envato.com/109596-envato-named-one-of-2015-s-best-places-to-work" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Places to Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are continuing to grow and we are looking for a Development Team Lead for our Platform Infrastructure team.

We have one ambition:&lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;To make online shopping simple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2014 investors backed this vision to the tune of $1m in 24hrs on the crowdfunding site, Seedrs. We followed up with a similar round in autumn 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this backing and our drive and determination we are making it simpler for consumers to get what they want, and simpler for big retailers to find their new customers. We have an awesome team, work in a fun environment and are tackling the biggest issues in shopping which affect hundreds of millions of consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we are solving this problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re building technology that enables the big stores to operate as a single digital marketplace, with all of the advantages of a marketplace for smaller retailers (think Amazon and Etsy); 1 stop shop, easy comparison, single checkout. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To do this we need to first amalgamate 3 million products from the top 200 retailers and make sense of them. We need to understand what a product is, it&amp;rsquo;s true availability (sizes, in stock), how it relates to other products (for comparison) and who to show it to (relevance). Then we need to make those products simple to buy, from multiple retailers, with one click.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We achieve this using various search, image recognition, macro, AI and API technologies. Over the past six months we have built a robust, horizontally-scalable and performant back-end infrastructure that processes over 3 million items per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Octer's tech stack is run on a LEMP architecture with performance and security improvements earned by integrating LXC virtual containers, job publish/consume processing and search indexing. All our code is integrated using a continuous integration pipeline initialised by hooks from Bitbucket into our Jenkins CI server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We operate on an Agile software development practice around GIT and JIRA, and implement a custom take on Git Flow branch management.

You'll have fixed points during the day but, as a team, you'll be trusted to manage&amp;nbsp;your location and hours to maximise your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code you produce will be fast, efficient, robust and readable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY WORK AT NETWEALTH?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be joining a hand-picked team, all brilliant in their respective fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be stretched and tested within a supportive team environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We love implementing new technologies that support our business needs; and we know our developers love this too.

Other parts of the system you will work on include account management, billing and payment systems for users, and monitoring system for other developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To imagine the scale and importance of the job, think of a CI service that builds customers' code and runs tests. For us, the builds and test running are the easy part. Compared to such a CI service, we produce much more data, and the data is less familiar to the customer. So it is crucial to make sure we work with the data in an efficient way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will you learn in this role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not having any dependency on legacy software, you will be able to learn and use latest web technologies. You will also learn a lot about security when making sure that a single customer's code and data are not accessible to other customers. This starts with preventing simple HTML script injections, and proceeds up to making sure that analysis of customers' code does not have undesirable side-effects. You will also make sure our billing and payment systems are operating securely.

Where a problem is ill-defined, a technology redundant, or a system bogged down in legacy code we frequently say no, but when the right client has the right project &amp;ndash; which is happening with increasing frequency as we gain a reputation &amp;ndash; we need the power to say yes. And to do this, we need Technical Leads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the most senior technical level on our projects, Technical Leads take ultimate responsibility for the design and delivery of enterprise-grade PaaS and SaaS solutions that favour a simple and maintainable approach over a clever and complex one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of integration and new development, our projects span four clearly defined types: &lt;em&gt;Identity &lt;/em&gt;maximises data capture from customer interaction and supports analysis to better understand and target audiences; &lt;em&gt;Hyperscale Transactions&lt;/em&gt; allow ambitious brands to handle almost limitless traffic without compromising customer experience; &lt;em&gt;Search and Insight &lt;/em&gt;draws data from disparate sources and makes it available to customers via a single Cloud-based search platform; and &lt;em&gt;Systems Integration, Build and Delivery &lt;/em&gt;means assembling out of the box Cloud solutions and implementing to mesh with existing systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across each, our Technical Leads drive solutions by matching customer requirements to appropriate technology in collaboration with Business Analysts, Project Managers &amp;amp; client-side stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once an outline solution is determined you&amp;rsquo;ll sit at the head of a Scrum team likely comprising .NET or Java, front-end, DevOps and QA Consultants (no two projects are the same) to deliver the planned solution, guiding the team through challenges and adjusting their approach as required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll oversee not just the development of code and integration of services but, with the support of experienced QA and DevOps Consultants, ensure this code is tested at every step of the path to production and deployed via completely automated tooling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you&amp;rsquo;ll work closely with Business Analysts and Project Mangers to clarify requirements, create a backlog and prioritise user stories, as the team&amp;rsquo;s key technical resource, you&amp;rsquo;ll also communicate complex concepts to non-technical stakeholders and contribute to client relationships at all levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Off project you&amp;rsquo;ll accumulate market know-how by keeping abreast of industry trends including new SaaS or PaaS products that might enhance Amido&amp;rsquo;s approach or product set, something we hope will encourage you towards supporting vendor evaluation, influencing decisions on technology investments and networking for new projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a small role.

All development proceeds according to modern software development practices such as continuous integration testing, and code produced needs to be mathematically correct and highly efficient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determining mathematical solutions to problems&lt;/strong&gt;, and determining how best to express those solutions in terms of computer code.&amp;nbsp; The problems to be solved may be concrete practical problems such as how to find an optimal investment strategy, or how best to calibrate a mathematical model to data, or more abstract problems such as how best to efficiently execute a sequence of mathematical operations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing and quality control&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;

At one end, there are essentially pure quants who hack programs together, and at the other end there are dedicated software developers with little mathematics.&amp;nbsp; We don't really fit in to that.&amp;nbsp; At RPC Consulting&amp;nbsp;we take the software development equally as seriously as the mathematics.&amp;nbsp; The team here are professional software developers at the same time as being serious mathematicians; we don't compromise on either area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please submit a CV and covering letter to Mark Sinclair-McGarvie at RPC Consulting.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2016 12:29:08 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-11-06T12:29:08Z</a10:updated><location xmlns="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/">Saffron Walden, UK</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/122809/senior-r-d-software-engineer-synopsys</guid><link>http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/122809/senior-r-d-software-engineer-synopsys</link><a10:author><a10:name>Synopsys</a10:name></a10:author><category>c++</category><title>Senior R&amp;D Software Engineer at Synopsys (Exeter, UK)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;We have a role in our TCAD Mesh Generation Group that would suit a talented software engineer/scientist looking to develop exciting applications used by international blue chip corporations, research institutions and universities worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The candidate will help the group develop new technologies in the Sentaurus product line.

We are always looking for creative and enthusiastic people who share that spirit to join our team. All of our work comes from recommendation and the fact we take great pride in the work that we do means that we continue to get recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our aim is to work in self-sufficient and collaborative cross-functional teams. We develop iteratively, responding to feedback and change, while taking a pragmatic approach to delivery. Communication is a key part of how we function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are committed to providing an atmosphere where everyone&amp;rsquo;s opinions and ideas are respected, work-life balance is valued and all our colleagues have opportunities to learn and grow.

You discover Marco is working on a story which is becoming more and more complex, so you help him keeping things simple and at the same time aligned better with the business case. After the stand up you sit beside Rafael who is having troubles working on a Google Analytics API client. You try to understand what is exactly the problem and with your help, Rafael come up with a new approach on how to solve the problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You meet a candidate over lunch. You aren&amp;rsquo;t looking at skills yet, you just want to get to know her. How would her personality match with the rest of the herd? Can she communicate ideas clearly and concisely? Can she talk fluently about the technologies Coolblue deploys? It&amp;rsquo;s your shot at filtering out candidates that don&amp;rsquo;t fit the mould. Not bad, not bad at all. She passes. For now. Of course, your senior team members will pick her apart technically later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the afternoon, you have a face to face sync with Rafael. You ask if the new approach for the API client is working. Then you talk about what he will be focusing on the upcoming months. He has no clear idea about that and so you ask him questions about which epic motivates him the most and which task he prefers. Rafael has a clearer idea now about his focus and he will think how to keep attention in this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Since you have no more meetings in the day, you propose a table tennis tournament with the whole team. The team loves that and even if you lose all of the matches, you have a great time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#39;ll work with one or two cross functional teams formed by Back-end and Front-end Developers, UX designers and a Scrum Master.

We also leverage a lot of open-source (CoreOS, etcd, Fleet, Docker, Prometheus, gRPC) and give back to the community when we can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are hiring across of all of our teams&amp;nbsp;(where multiple&amp;nbsp;positions at all levels exist), with a lot of opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;designing and implementing new algorithms to distribute and scale our simulations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;integrating new workers with our distributed stack&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;core infrastructure that underpins seamless scaling (networking, packing, storage, containers, logging, security across all compute providers)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;creation of world-class, robust APIs and SDKs for external customers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;developing tooling to understand, visualise and reason about large real-time simulations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;researching new applications of our tech and developing proof of concepts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;customer facing roles working with world-class organisations to explore the possibilities of SpatialOS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Oct 2016 12:06:55 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-10-28T12:06:55Z</a10:updated><location xmlns="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/">London, UK</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/118704/senior-full-stack-security-developer-financial-times</guid><link>http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/118704/senior-full-stack-security-developer-financial-times</link><a10:author><a10:name>Financial Times</a10:name></a10:author><category>security</category><category>https</category><category>java</category><category>saml</category><category>python</category><title>Senior Full Stack Security Developer at Financial Times (London, UK)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;It takes a cutting edge technology stack to provide the foundation for the cutting edge journalism that the Financial Times is renowned for.

With buyers and sellers using our website and mobile applications in over 60 countries, 30 languages and hundreds of delivery and payment options, we're constantly taking on tough, exciting engineering challenges - and we're doing it at scale! We are looking for passionate, skilled Developers who want to make meaningful, measurable improvements that impact millions of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How We Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We work in a start-up like manner and we work in small scrum teams of 4-7. Every team member is encouraged to take full ownership of their part of the platform but also to contribute ideas, suggestions and code to other areas of the business. We believe that features have no value until they are in production adding value to our customers so teams deploy fast and often. The tech team is building something that has never been built before so we're always trying to think outside the box. We hold monthly hackathons where team members inside and outside of tech bring their most creative ideas for the product; some of which even make it to production the same night!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples&amp;nbsp;of cool things we built in 2015:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;We built a notification platform (comprised of RabbitMQ, C# Services, SQL Enterprise) which handles thousands of concurrent changes every minute. This reduced the latency for sale notifications from hours to seconds. We built a scalable delivery pipeline that delivers notifications in real-time to website users (via SignalR) and iOS and Android users (via Microsoft Azure Notification Hub).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;We built a world class, hypermedia driven, RESTful API with outstanding&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://developer.viagogo.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;and several&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/viagogo" rel="nofollow"&gt;open source SDKs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;written in .NET, Ruby, Python and PHP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2016 12:16:08 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-10-18T12:16:08Z</a10:updated><location xmlns="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/">London, UK</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/113915/nodejs-javascript-developer-for-our-awesome-nexmo</guid><link>http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/113915/nodejs-javascript-developer-for-our-awesome-nexmo</link><a10:author><a10:name>Nexmo</a10:name></a10:author><category>node.js</category><category>javascript</category><category>mongodb</category><title>Node.JS / Javascript Developer for our Awesome Team!! at Nexmo (London, UK)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;We are Nexmo.

After the shift to digital music, the rise of subscription music services has pretty much obliterated the need to own the actual media. If you always have access to whatever music you want to listen to, there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to drive to the store and pay for an album that costs more than a month&amp;rsquo;s subscription for unlimited music access. Now that we&amp;rsquo;re in a world where we subscribe to Spotify or Apple Music, this seems obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We used to buy music. Now we subscribe.

Er wordt daarbij veel aandacht besteed aan IT-kwaliteit en architectuur. Er wordt gewerkt volgens een agile development aanpak (scrum). Wij ontwikkelen in Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 en gebruiken Microsoft Team Foundation (TFS) voor het development proces. Onze databases zijn SQL 2014 en in het business intelligence domein gebruiken wij onder andere Business Objects voor analyses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wat ga je doen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Als Database Administrator ben je medeverantwoordelijk voor het aanmaken en onderhouden van productiedatabases voor onze website, back-end systemen en marketingomgeving. Dit betekent dat je zorgt voor consistentie van modellen en code. Verder zorg je dat onze databases robuust zijn, een goede performance hebben en dat we een veilige omgeving hebben en houden. Je signaleert problemen en lost die op in overleg met de business, webdevelopers en onze IT-Services afdeling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In ons applicatielandschap ondersteun je ontwikkelaars bij het maken van database modellen en review je door ontwikkelaars opgeleverde SQL code. Daarnaast maak en onderhoud je onze data-import en export processen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Voor onze marketingomgeving bouw je de koppelingen met bronsystemen, onderhoud je de ETL-applicaties en ontsluiting naar Business Objects. Op deze manier help je onze Marketing en Business Intelligence afdelingen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Je levert bijdragen aan het verder verhogen van de kwaliteit van onze data en het effectief inzetten van de beschikbare business intelligence capaciteit. Je werkt nauw samen met onze DBA en participeert in verschillende teams met business intelligence analisten, webdevelopers, de ketenbeheerders en/of webmasters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waar kom je terecht?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Independer is anders dan anderen, ook als werkgever.

En dat alles in een open, ontspannen omgeving waar je niet in pak hoeft rond te lopen, je lunch verzorgd wordt en je zelf mag kiezen of&amp;nbsp;je buiten of binnen je meeting houdt. Met een hecht, betrokken en gezellig team van ruim 250 Independers werken we hard met elkaar om Independer elke dag weer een beetje beter te maken.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wat wij zoeken in onze nieuwe Database Administrator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minimaal &lt;strong&gt;vijf jaar &lt;/strong&gt;relevante&lt;strong&gt; werkervaring&lt;/strong&gt; als &lt;strong&gt;databasespecialist&lt;/strong&gt; (met &lt;strong&gt;SQL&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Je kunt query plans analyseren en vertalen naar acties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Je schrijft complexe SQL code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Je maakt CLR code binnen de database waar dit nodig is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minimaal&lt;strong&gt; twee jaar&lt;/strong&gt; relevante &lt;strong&gt;werkervaring&lt;/strong&gt; als &lt;strong&gt;ontwikkelaar&lt;/strong&gt; (met C#) in een complexe omgeving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Een hoog probleemoplossend vermogen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hbo werk- en denkniveau&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Goede kennis van &lt;strong&gt;.Net&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; C#&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; XML &lt;/strong&gt;en&lt;strong&gt; ETL&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nauwkeurig, resultaatgericht en oog voor kwaliteit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;In staat in processen te denken, de keten te overzien en bottlenecks te herkennen en op te lossen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wat krijg jij van ons?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jezelf kunnen zijn&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vieren als er iets te vieren valt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Een open, informele en hechte cultuur&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gezellige borrels, feesten en Independer weekend&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vergaderen in de zon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kok voor diner&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uitgebreide lunch met saladebar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tafeltennistafel / flipperkast/ gameroom&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gezamenlijke sport- en funactiviteiten&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flexibiliteit in je werktijden&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Premievrij pensioen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relevante trainingen en opleidingen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 verlofdagen (bij een 40-urige werkweek)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bonusregeling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heb je nog vragen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neem gerust contact op met Floor van Dam, Recruiter Independer sinds 2013, telefoonnummer 035-6265505.

The SCRiBBR philosophy is to solve problems together, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be involved in every process &amp;ndash; from the design and concept phase straight through to the realization of a solution. No two weeks are ever the same!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we are looking for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally you are a PHP back-end developer with at least four years of experience.

You&amp;rsquo;ll explain to a junior developer from the team why the choice of a specific design pattern is so important within our application.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll create a use-case for a technical design and coordinate with the rest of the team concerning who will implement different features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;As you get to of point of being able to navigate the application blindfolded, you&amp;rsquo;ll be in a position to start developing new features. You&amp;rsquo;ll develop new services with our back-end application and ensure that the functionalities are covered by test cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;New ideas for the application are always on the back burner. You&amp;rsquo;ll propose moving features from the backlog forward to the current milestone, as another developer working on the same component is developing a related feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll enter deprecations into the current code base through semantic versioning, which will ensure that the major release schedules for later in the year stays on track.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;When the Symfony component you have used to implement a feature could also use improvement, you&amp;rsquo;ll put the LTS version on the Github PR and ask the core Symfony team to review it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who will you be working with?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SCRiBBR team is young, international, and dynamic.

The feature&amp;rsquo;s translation-release cycle needs some attention to ensure it can be rolled out in 11 languages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Around 18:00&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; It&amp;rsquo;s time to get on your bike to go home&amp;hellip; or perhaps you decide to join your colleagues for dinner at the office?!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of the things we have achieved in the last three months alone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;We&amp;nbsp;won the&amp;nbsp;Best Entrepreneurial Student Initiative&amp;nbsp;and is nominated for the&amp;nbsp;Deloitte Rising Star 2016.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;We went online in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland.

Tot slot houdt je versiebeheer in de gaten en treed je op als vraagbaak voor de Quants. De rol is nieuw binnen de afdeling, wat inhoudt dat het professionaliseren en standaardiseren van werken met R onder jouw verantwoording komt te liggen. Dit zal met name kennisdeling zijn; het organiseren van bijeenkomsten voor zowel key users als management over de mogelijkheden die R als ontwikkeltaal en software omgeving biedt.

A major part of this is writing and owning the code that drives our products. But the role of a C++ Software Engineer is much bigger than &amp;lsquo;simply&amp;rsquo; writing code. Software Engineers work on the whole development process, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;suggesting and deciding what features to build&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;driving the design&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;writing the code (of course)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;pushing, testing, documenting the feature&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineering Driven.

We put a premium on building and using tools that make everyone super-productive. This translates into quicker turnaround times on new features and products for increased revenue with smaller teams. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We value openness. No part of the company is off-limits, meaning that our engineers have the chance to work on a variety of different areas. Our interns have the same responsibility as our full timers who have the same responsibility as our old timers and all get to work side-by-side on important, customer-impacting

Hoe dit opleidingstraject er exact uit komt te zien is aan jou en afhankelijk waarin je je wilt verdiepen en welke technische basis je al hebt. Je krijgt de mogelijkheid dingen uit te proberen en te experimenteren, waarbij je de hulp krijgt van onze senior developer uit Hengelo alsook van collega's uit een internationale werkomgeving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Je komt te werken in het Projects &amp;amp; Services team. In dit team hebben we een veelzijdigheid aan werkzaamheden. Denk hierbij aan het bouwen van uiteenlopende oplossingen voor diverse nationale en internationale klanten en support aan klanten via diverse communicatiekanalen. Onze software oplossingen betreffen betrouwbare administratieve database systemen op Windows Client/Server. Daarnaast realiseren wij oplossingen die voor internet en op mobile devices moeten functioneren, iOS, Android, Windows, online en offline. Dat betekent dat je al gauw diverse kennisgebieden goed moet beheersen, of snel eigen weet te maken zoals bijvoorbeeld de bekende Java stack (oa.

Figuring our product out and getting users to switch is a tough challenge and we want your insights and experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every one of us has had several start-up experiences and on average we have 10+ years of experience in somehow similar challenges. We know success, we know failure; we've built platforms from scratch, we've dealt with large legacy systems. We care about each other and about the product we're building.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some of the past projects where our engineers have been involved before joining OnTruck are: building the billing system for one of the largest telephony operators in Spain, building up and optimising complex marketplaces handling millions of orders a month, building real time video chats, building a global oauth/identity provider, improving the garbage collector of the JVM, creating social network libraries even before Facebook existed, building the Eurofighter simulator used to train pilots, building kernel modules to deal with real-time processor allocation, creating NLP algorithms to score user comments and timeline recommendation algorithms, building software to manage a backbone network and dealt with the logistic platform of a big supermarket chain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Investors like our concept and team and we've been quite successful in fundraising and gathering resources to support our future growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The engineering culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;We value speed of iteration and best practices and we care about our craft: both our API and key JavaScript code have 100% test coverage, for instance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;We get engineers as close to the business problems as possible, so everybody can be involved in product decisions. We have mechanisms to enable anybody in the company to bring their new ideas to decision makers since we believe that innovative ideas come from everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The stack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have a decoupled architecture, based on REST APIs and asynchronous services. We work with React in the frontend platforms (customers and admin), native in mobile apps (drivers), Python/Django in the backend and we're currently evaluating Elixir for some services. Our DB is PostgreSQL and the queues run on RabbitMQ.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;We use a dedicated ERP to avoid reinventing the wheel there and we also have built a DWH/Analytics platform which takes advantage of external solutions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we offer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;An office in downtown Madrid (Chamber&amp;iacute;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A laid-back&amp;nbsp;culture where everybody is encouraged&amp;nbsp;to participate in discussions and contribute.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opportunities for personal growth and learning (we hold regular tech talks and encourage working on different parts of the platform).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good salaries and stock options packages. We want our engineers to have ownership and participate in company success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flexible schedule (though no regular remote working since we believe in face-to-face communication).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2016 08:10:58 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-11-12T08:10:58Z</a10:updated><location xmlns="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/">Madrid, Spain</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/127977/it-systemadministrator-m-w-ibg-prüfcomputer-gmbh</guid><link>http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/127977/it-systemadministrator-m-w-ibg-pr%C3%BCfcomputer-gmbh</link><a10:author><a10:name>ibg Prüfcomputer GmbH</a10:name></a10:author><category>exchange-server</category><category>sharepoint</category><category>sql</category><category>sysadmin</category><title>IT-Systemadministrator (m/w) at ibg Prüfcomputer GmbH (Ebermannstadt, Deutschland)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ihre Aufgaben:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Planung, Konfiguration und Betreuung unserer Netzwerkinfrastruktur (LAN, WAN, VPN) sowie unserer Server und VMs im Windows-Umfeld&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Administration von Datensicherung und Sicherheitsaspekten&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Auswahl und Betreuung betriebswirtschaftlicher Softwaresysteme&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Installation und Betreuung von PC&amp;lsquo;s und Workstations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2016 08:52:15 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-10-31T08:52:15Z</a10:updated><location xmlns="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/">Ebermannstadt, Deutschland</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/127141/back-end-nodejs-developer-ixara-ltd</guid><link>http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/127141/back-end-nodejs-developer-ixara-ltd</link><a10:author><a10:name>iXara Ltd</a10:name></a10:author><category>node.js</category><category>javascript</category><category>bash</category><category>linux</category><category>tdd</category><title>Back-end Node.js Developer at iXara Ltd (Hemel Hempstead, UK) (allows remote)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re building something very special and for this we need very special developers who like a challenge.

You will take over responsibility for a client-server system that is currently deployed on PlanetLab Europe (PLE), a testbed consisting of hundreds of servers around Europe that are connected to the Internet. This mapping system consists of: measurement agents deployed on PLE servers, a central control system that monitors and directs the agents, and a database that collects these measurements. The measurements are made using tools such as ping, traceroute, and iperf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;You will be working with a team of researchers at UPMC Sorbonne Universit&amp;eacute;s and elsewhere who are developing new ways to understand the structure of the Internet and how the network evolves over time. You will be the principal developer of the measurement system on which the researchers will run their experiments. The researchers and interns will contribute to the system as they create algorithms to direct the measurements, and they will do so under your technical guidance. There will be systems engineers to ensure the functioning of PLE and other servers that you use. Your supervisors will be UPMC faculty members Timur Friedman and Olivier Fourmaux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime considerations in your work will be the reliability and performance of the measurement system. The PlanetLab servers and the network in between are subject to failures, and taking this into account is essential in the design of a distributed system that as a whole continues to function even when individual servers are down or unreachable. Also, we envision collecting large amounts of data and making the data accessible to researchers for computation-intensive analysis, and the databases must be able to scale accordingly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will take over a functioning initial system. You will then have considerable autonomy in determining future development directions for the system, including the choice of language (it is currently written mostly in Python), webservice API (it currently has a RESTful API), and database technology (it currently uses PostgreSQL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will create online documentation and tutorials to support users of the measurement system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will work in a French-speaking environment, and you must have some basic knowledge of French in order to start the job. To be effective in your job, a working knowledge of English is also required.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2016 15:42:53 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-10-24T15:42:53Z</a10:updated><location xmlns="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/">Paris, France</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/118295/bi-developer-evision-industry-software</guid><link>http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/118295/bi-developer-evision-industry-software</link><a10:author><a10:name>eVision Industry Software</a10:name></a10:author><category>business-intelligence</category><category>.net</category><category>cqrs</category><category>scrum</category><category>jasperserver</category><title>BI Developer at eVision Industry Software (Den Haag, Netherlands)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;As market leaders, we have high expectations of ourselves &amp;ndash; quality, reliability, safety of our products &amp;ndash; and strive for continuous improvement.

Looking for real problems to solve and real technical challenges? Then you should continue reading. Because the development of NetEnt&amp;rsquo;s LiveCasino is not a walk in the park. It&amp;rsquo;s a highly challenging job where your creativity would be tested to its limit. But at the same time, if you have what it takes, you would love it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s so challenging about it? Well, we are developing a live streaming product in a gaming environment, a live casino, with dealers working on the other side of Europe. We need to deploy to several servers and this for all web browsers and operating systems. For desktop, tablets and mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing code from scratch, decide how the client should look like. This is a product we are building right now and how this should be done is up to you and your team. You would be a part of a highly competent team of developers to create an amazing large scale product and experience. We work in small, collaborative Scrum teams where ownership of the outcome is the key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we do it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We build for the long term with focus on maintainability and quality. And we breathe TDD. A day here would look something like this: Coffee, stand up meeting, discussing a technical problem, coffee, design, implementation, writing unit tests, collaboration with testers. You would also probably eat some lunch there in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the LiveCasino team we chose our own OS and always strive to work with the best and most suitable technology such as EcmaScript 6, Karma, Mocha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creative! And a problem solver, I know it&amp;rsquo;s a clich&amp;eacute;, but with this this product there&amp;rsquo;s no other way. Equally important, you&amp;rsquo;re a team player who like to cooperative and communicate with people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enjoy NetEnt you need to respond positively to an environment where flexibility and adaptability to swiftly changing situations is required. Hopefully you&amp;rsquo;re curious and like to explore new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, important; you enjoy challenges. Others are doing what we are building, but we are here to do it even better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you want to hear more about the work life at NetEnt, for instance our 6 weeks of vacation, 5000 SEK in health benefits, why we have a person working 100% with health and energizing activities or our innovation events?

importantly, to stay in our company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other feedback we often receive is that people really like our location (Kuala Lumpur) because it is ideal to explore and experience the South East Asia and the Pacific regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course it also doesn't hurt that we offer a very competitive package which includes quarterly and yearly performance bonuses, medical insurance, tax relief assistance, interest free loans and relocation assistance to name but a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this
